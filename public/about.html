<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>"I am a professional with a solid background in biotechnology, currently transitioning into the software development field.
  I am pursuing a new degree in software development and have acquired skills in Python, Javascript, HTML5, and CSS, along with 
  proficiency in the Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint). My experience in biotechnology has equipped me with 
  strong analytical skills, such as the ability to solve complex problems, and a collaborative approach, all of which are highly 
  transferable to software development. </p>
<p>  I am seeking internship or junior positions where I can apply my new skills and continue learning.
