        <hr>
        <h2><b> Felipe Yukio Ishikawa Fragoso</b></h2>
        
        <p> I am a professional with a solid background in biotechnology, currently transitioning into the software development field.
            I am pursuing a new degree in software development and have acquired skills in Python, Javascript, HTML5, and CSS, along with 
            proficiency in the Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint). My experience in biotechnology has equipped me with 
            strong analytical skills, such as the ability to solve complex problems, and a collaborative approach, all of which are highly 
            transferable to software development. I am seeking internship or junior positions where I can apply my new skills and continue learning. 
            Let’s connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team and projects! </p>
